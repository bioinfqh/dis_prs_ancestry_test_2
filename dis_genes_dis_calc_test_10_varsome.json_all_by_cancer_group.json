the protein. The p.Ser12Ter variant has been reported in two studies and is found in a homozygous state in five probands from three families including two sibling pairs (Kohl et al. 2012; Pedurupillay et al. 2016). Three of the probands are diagnosed with incomplete achromatopsia and two with cone dystrophy. The unaffected parents of the siblings were confirmed heterozygotes for the p.Ser12Ter variant. The p.Ser12Ter variant was absent from 180 control subjects and is reported at a frequency of 0.000166 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Based on the potential impact of stop-gained variants and evidence from the literature, the p.Ser12Ter variant is classified as likely pathogenic for PDE6H-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.", "report_date": "2018-08-23", "labrank": "999"}]], "Frequencies": {"Gene": "PDE6H",

The variant was reported in numerous CAMPT patients in the literature, both in the homozygous and compound heterozygous state.
