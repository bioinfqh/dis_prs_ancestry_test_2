This variant was found in 56/121606 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0004605, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic MPL variant (0.002357). The variant was reported in numerous CAMPT patients in the literature, both in the homozygous and compound heterozygous state. Functional studies have shown the variant to lead to abnormal subcellular receptor distribution, lack of membrane localization, impaired glycosylation as well as impaired TPO signal transduction (Stockklausner_2015, Tijssen_2008). Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic."}, {"clin_sig": "Pathogenic", "name": "NaN", "comment": "This sequence change replaces arginine with proline at codon 102 of the MPL protein (p.Arg102Pro). The arginine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between arginine and proline. This variant is present in population databases (rs28928907, ExAC 0.08%). This variant has been observed on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from a pathogenic variant in individuals affected with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) (PMID: 11972523, 28859041). This variant has also been observed to be homozygous or in combination with another MPL variant in several individuals affected with CAMT (PMID: 10971406, 16470591, 18240171, 19302922, 21225925, 24119002, 26854587). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 14158). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change impairs trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface, glycosylation of the protein, and proliferative responses to thrombopoietin (PMID: 18422784, 19302922, 24438083, 25538044). This variant disrupts the p.Arg102 amino acid residue in MPL. Other variant(s) that disrupt this residue have been observed in individuals with MPL-related conditions (PMID: 21659346, 16470591), which suggests that this may be a clinically significant amino acid residue.
