This variant was found in 56/121606 control chromosomes at a frequency of 0.0004605, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic MPL variant (0.002357). The variant was reported in numerous CAMPT patients in the literature, both in the homozygous and compound heterozygous state. Functional studies have shown the variant to lead to abnormal subcellular receptor distribution, lack of membrane localization, impaired glycosylation as well as impaired TPO signal transduction (Stockklausner_2015, Tijssen_2008). Taken together, this variant is classified as pathogenic.", "report_date": "2017-04-17"}, "Frequencies": {"Gene": "MPL", "Transcript": "ENST00000372470.9", "DNA change": "c.305G>C", "Protein change": "p.Arg102Pro", "Genomic Location": "chr1:43338634", "Alternate Allele Fraction": "0.04%", "dbSNP rsID": "rs28928907"}, "Publications": [{"Pubmed ID": "10971406", "Title": "Mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor, Mpl, in children with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia."}, {"Pubmed ID": "18422784", "Title": "Functional analysis of single amino-acid mutations in the thrombopoietin-receptor Mpl underlying congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia."}, {"Pubmed ID": "24728327", "Title": "Germline variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in a healthy, ancestrally diverse cohort: implications for individual genome sequencing."}, {"Pubmed ID": "32581363", "Title": "Monogenic and polygenic inheritance become instruments for clonal selection."}]}, "PDE6H c.35C>G": {"Gene Data": {"Number": 2, "Classification": "Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity", "Gene": "PDE6H", "Exon/Intron": "1", "SNP ID": "rs200311463", "DNA change": "c.35C>G", "Protein change": "p.Ser12Ter", "Transcript ID": "ENST00000266395.3", "Zygosity": "heterozygous", "Inheritance": "not given", "Associated Disease(s)": ["PDE6H-Related Disorders", "Retinal cone dystrophy 3A", "Achromatopsia 6"], "Cancer Groups": ["HEMATOLOGIC"]}, "Comments": {"clin_sig": "Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity", "lab_name": "Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory,Illumina", "comment": "The PDE6H c.35C>G (p.Ser12Ter) variant is a stop-gained variant that is predicted to result in a premature termination of the protein. The p.Ser12Ter variant has been reported in two studies and is found in a homozygous state in five probands from three families including two sibling pairs (Kohl et al. 2012; Pedurupillay et al. 2016). Three of the probands are diagnosed with incomplete achromatopsia and two with cone dystrophy. The unaffected parents of the siblings were confirmed heterozygotes for the p.Ser12Ter variant. The p.Ser12Ter variant was absent from 180 control subjects and is reported at a frequency of 0.000166 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Based on the potential impact of stop-gained variants and evidence from the literature, the p.Ser12Ter variant is classified as likely pathogenic for PDE6H-related disorders.
